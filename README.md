<b>Britta</b> was a beautiful and easy to use <b>Discord Music Bot</b> that was used worldwide by almost 40.000 users.<br/>
It supported <b>songs, albums, playlists, artist top tracks, live streams and custom search queries</b><br/>
from <b>YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, Twitch</b> and more.</b><br/>Everything for free 24/7!<br/>
Since YouTube doesn't allow streaming videos anymore many Discord Music Bots have ended their service. Unfortunately this includes Britta. The bot had to be taken offline in September 2021. Although the bot is written in Discord.js v12 I hope the code will be at least inspiration and help for many future Discord bot developers.<br/><br/><b>Thanks  to all the users, guild owners and everybody else participating in this project in any way!</><br/>
